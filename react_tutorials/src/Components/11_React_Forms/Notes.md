<!-- 1 .Contolled Vs Uncontrolled Components -->

// Controlled Components are those where the data is handled by the react component state.

1. State management - The value of input field is controlled by react state.(useState or this.state).
2. Event Handlers - Changes in the input firld are handled by react event handlers(onChnage, onBlur).
3. State Updates - When state interacts with the form input, react state is updated through event handlers, and the input value reflects the current state value.

// Uncontrolled Components are those where data is handled by the DOM itself.
